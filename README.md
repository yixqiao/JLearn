# JLearn
Java library for machine learning.  
Focuses on being easy to use and configure.

*View demos at [JLearnDemos](https://github.com/yixqiao/JLearnDemos).*

***STILL IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT.***  
Basic library might be put out in 2-3 days.  
Polished library should be available in about 2 weeks.

### Goals
- Create and train a neural network in a few lines of intuitive code
- Easily access and change internals of the neural network
- Fast implementation of matrices
- Basic data processing
- Various me.yixqiao.losses and optimizers
