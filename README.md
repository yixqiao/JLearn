*View demos at [JLearnDemos](https://github.com/yixqiao/JLearnDemos).*  
*View Javadocs at [project page](https://yixqiao.github.io/JLearn/).*

**STILL IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT.**  
Basic library has been put out in [packages](https://github.com/yixqiao/JLearn/packages), but is not completely ready yet.  
Polished library should be available in about 2 weeks.

### Goals
- Create and train a neural network in a few lines of intuitive code
- Easily access and change internals of the neural network
- Fast implementation of matrices
- Basic data processing
- Various losses and optimizers
